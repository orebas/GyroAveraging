Functions are approximated to essentially machine precision by using iterative Gaussian elimination with complete pivoting to form “chebfun2” objects representing low rank approximations. Operations such as integration, differentiation, function evaluation, and transforms are particularly efficient. Global optimization, the singular value decomposition, and rootfinding are also extended to chebfun2 objects. Numerical applications are presented.},

This new scheme uses an intermediate velocity grid whose resolution is adapted to the local thermal Larmor radius. The charge density is computed by projecting marker weights in a field-line following manner while preserving the adiabatic magnetic moment \$\textbackslash mu\$. These choices permit to improve the accuracy of the gyroaveraging operations performed with matrices even when strong spatial variation of temperature and magnetic field is present. Accuracy of the scheme in different geometries from simple 2d slab geometry to realistic 3d toroidal equilibrium has been studied. A successful implementation in the grokinetic code XGC is presented in the delta-f limit.},

Yet no book dedicated to Chebyshev polynomials has been published since 1990, and even that work focused primarily on the theoretical aspects. A broad, up-to-date treatment is long overdue.Providing highly readable exposition on the subject's state of the art, Chebyshev Polynomials is just such a treatment. It includes rigorous yet down-to-earth coverage of the theory along with an in-depth look at the properties of all four kinds of Chebyshev polynomials-properties that lead to a range of results in areas such as approximation, series expansions, interpolation, quadrature, and integral equations. Problems in each chapter, ranging in difficulty from elementary to quite advanced, reinforce the concepts and methods presented.Far from being an esoteric subject, Chebyshev polynomials lead one on a journey through all areas of numerical analysis. This book is the ideal vehicle with which to begin this journey and one that will also serve as a standard reference for many years to come.},

The algorithm relies on regularizing the Fourier transform of the Green's function by cutting off the interaction in physical space beyond the domain of interest. This permits the straightforward application of trapezoidal quadrature and the standard FFT, with superalgebraic convergence for smooth data. Moreover, the method can be interpreted as employing a Nystrom discretization of the corresponding integral operator, with matrix entries which can be obtained explicitly and rapidly. This is of use in the design of preconditioners or fast direct solvers for a variety of volume integral equations. The method proposed permits the computation of any derivative of the potential, at the cost of an additional FFT.},

Although α and −α produce the same differential equation, it is conventional to define different Bessel functions for these two values in such a way that the Bessel functions are mostly smooth functions of α. The most important cases are when α is an integer or half-integer. Bessel functions for integer α are also known as cylinder functions or the cylindrical harmonics because they appear in the solution to Laplace's equation in cylindrical coordinates. Spherical Bessel functions with half-integer α are obtained when the Helmholtz equation is solved in spherical coordinates.},
